\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Tiptop is a useful application, and our extensions further enhance its utility.
However, there are two major issues that require further investigation.

First, our solution to the ``Too many open file descriptors bug" is unfortunately not comprehensive. On systems that have more than 819 processes and a hard file descriptor limit of 4096, this will still be an issue.
We do not believe that it is reasonable to require superuser permissions to solve this problem.
%We see two possible solutions to this.
Therefore, as one solution, it may be possible to develop a heuristic algorithm that only opens a file descriptor for processes of interest.
As an example the algorithm can create a hardware counter (i.e., open a file descriptor) for any process that has used the CPU in the last $N$ seconds.
Of course, this will require process monitoring that does not use hardware performance counters.
However, we believe that the overhead of such a strategy is justified, in order to minimize the probability of this bug occurring.
%Alternatively, we have not fully investigated the opportunities that PAPI may present in mitigating this problem.

Second, we found that tiptop is not well-supported in virtualized environments.
The man page breifly mentions this, but does not elaborate further.
Our testing confirms that data is often omitted or not reported correctly in VM instances.
We believe this requires further investigation to understand why this is the case.
Certainly, for testing purposes, the ability to test tiptop without requiring physical hardware would greatly increase the ability to verify that features are correctly implemented across CPU architectures.
